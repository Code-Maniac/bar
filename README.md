# build-and-run
Simple utility script to build and run a project within a git repository with
arguments

## Installation
Run the install script
```bash
sudo ./install
```

## Usage
```bash
bar
```

## Supports
* CMake
* Makefile
Note however that the identification of the executable is extremely primitive
and simply runs the first executable found in the build directory. A very
standard build system structure is therefore required
